# glitch-cli

the handy CLI to manage and change or even optimise your glitch project!

----------

# what will it do?

it will:

- allow you to convert your project into one with nodejs support
- force stop your webserver
- clear your project completely, quite dangerous i think
- allow you to get help on simple topics!
- show your status

and much more!

it won't:

- give you sudo
- hack MI6
- delete everything or
- make you a nice dinner

-----------

# where is everything?!

not much yet, we only started today. But changes will be released ASAP

--------
# can I help?

sure! get the code on glitch or send a pull request (or both)

-----------

# is this official?

no, glitch isn't involved in anyway so its enitrely 3rd party work
